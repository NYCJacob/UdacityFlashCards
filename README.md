This is is my submission for Udacity's React NanoDegree programm React Native course.

**Installation**
- npm install
- npm start

**Usage**
- app only tested for Android
- app opens to a tab view of the Deck List and Add Deck view defaulting to Deck List
- Deck List show a touchable lists of quiz decks available
- Add deck open input form to create a new deck, upon creation app goes to home tab view of Deck List
- Deck view show questions in deck, add quiz item button, delete deck button, and, if there are quiz items, start quiz button
- Upon completion of quiz score is present with option to retake quiz

**Issues** 
- Delete deck throws error as app tries to render deleted deck
- App hangs on submission of quiz item
- Both of the above work, ie deck is deleted and quiz item is added, when app refreshed.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
